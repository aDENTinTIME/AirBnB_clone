# AirBnB Clone

## Description
This is the first lite clone of the AirBnB website. It specifies classes for User, Place, State, City, Amenity, and Review that inherit from the BaseModel class. Instances are serialized and saved to a JSON file then reloaded and deserialized back into instances. Additionally, there is a simple command line interface (CLI) or 'console' that abstracts the process used to create these instances.

## Usage
The console can run in two modes: interactive and non-interactive:

### Interactive mode

To run the console in interactive mode type:
```./console.py```
A prompt will appear:
```(hbnb) ```

where you can type your commands and see output related to running those commands::
```(hbnb) all```
```["[User] (0a7adbf6-ea6f-4447-9e7e-c160687632e7) {'id': '0a7adbf6-ea6f-4447-9e7e-c160687632e7', 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2018, 6, 13, 23, 38, 38, 231906), 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2018, 6, 13, 23, 38, 38, 231906)}"```
```(hbnb) ```

### Non-interactive mode
