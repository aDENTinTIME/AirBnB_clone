# AirBnB Clone

## Description
This is the first lite clone of the AirBnB website. It specifies classes for User, Place, State, City, Amenity, and Review that inherit from the BaseModel class. Instances are serialized and saved to a JSON file then reloaded and deserialized back into instances. Additionally, there is a simple command line interface (CLI) that abstracts the process used to create these instances.
